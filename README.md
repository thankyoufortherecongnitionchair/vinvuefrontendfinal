This Repo contains the backend implementation of my reviews hosting website. Implemented mainly using Angular for the Front-end (Dashboard view), and TypeScript used to handle all of the transaction logic (CRUD operations) and real-time user authentication and content validation. 

Follow the instructions given below to implement this on your own systems. Built using Angular 16 and TypeScript.
